## Self-Driving-Car
###This project aims to develop and train a machine learning model to assist in the development of a self-driving car system. It consists of two main components: data processing and model training.

# Data Processing and Self-Driving Car Model Training

## Overview
This project consists of two Jupyter notebooks:
1. **data_processing_and_regression.ipynb**: Handles data preprocessing, regression analysis, and visualization.
2. **self_driving_model_training.ipynb**: Trains a deep learning model for self-driving car simulation using image data.

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for the list of Python dependencies.

## Usage
1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the data processing notebook:
   ```
   jupyter notebook data_processing_and_regression.ipynb
   ```

3. Train the self-driving car model:
   ```
   jupyter notebook self_driving_model_training.ipynb
   ```

## Project Structure
- `data_processing_and_regression.ipynb`: Data loading, cleaning, visualization, and regression model implementation.
- `self_driving_model_training.ipynb`: Neural network model creation, training, and evaluation for self-driving car tasks.

## Notes
- Ensure you have the required datasets placed in the appropriate directories as mentioned in the notebooks.
- GPU usage is recommended for faster training of the self-driving model.
