# Self-Driving-Car
This project aims to develop and train a machine learning model to assist in the development of a self-driving car system. It consists of two main components: data processing and model training.
---


## Overview  

The project includes two Jupyter notebooks:  

- **`data_processing_and_regression.ipynb`**: Handles data preprocessing, regression analysis, and visualization.  
- **`self_driving_model_training.ipynb`**: Trains a deep learning model for self-driving car simulation using image data.  

## Requirements  

Ensure you have all required dependencies installed. You can find them listed in `requirements.txt`.  

### Installation  

To install the necessary dependencies, run:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage  

1. **Run the data processing notebook**  

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook data_processing_and_regression.ipynb
   ```  

2. **Train the self-driving car model**  

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook self_driving_model_training.ipynb
   ```  



## Notes  

- Ensure you have the required datasets placed in the appropriate directories as specified in the notebooks.  
   You can access Sully Chen's self-driving car datasets on GitHub:
   Repository: SullyChen/driving-datasets 
- **GPU usage is recommended** for faster training of the self-driving model.
